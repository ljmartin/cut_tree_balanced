# cutTreeBalanced

Cutting linkage graphs (i.e. dendrograms) to achieve hierarchical clustering with balanced size.

## Abstract

Hierarchical (a.k.a. agglomerative) linkage techniques are common in a wide range of fields such as economics, bioinformatics, (`some fields`). The output of these techniques are dendrograms, which are directed acylic graphs (`note: not just DAGs - they have tree structure`) that define the linkage between input data. Generating clusters from dendrograms requires some method of cutting to separate groups of points from each other.. Many existing cutting techniques lead to clusters with highly imbalanced sizes. This paper presents and demonstrates balancedCut for Python - a method of cutting dendrograms with balanced cluster sizes.
